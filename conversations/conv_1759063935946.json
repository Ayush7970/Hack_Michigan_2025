I specialize in Python web development and API design with Flask and Django, so I'd be happy to see how I can help bring your vision to life."

      "content": "Thanks! Yes, ABG is an urgent API project. Your Flask/Django skills sound perfect. What's your standard hourly rate, and do you offer any flexibility for project size or fixed-price options? We're looking for a fair agreement."

    {
      "role": "agent",
      "content": "Thanks for the quick response! That's excellent to hear my skills align with your urgent API project.\n\nMy standard hourly rate is $50/hr. For projects like ABG, I'm definitely open to discussing flexible arrangements, including project-based rates or even a fixed-price option, once we have a clearer understanding of the scope. My priority is to find a fair agreement that ensures your project's success.\n\nTo help me provide a more tailored estimate, could you share a few more details on the project's requirements or desired timeline?"

      "role": "agent",
      "content": "Great question! For a fixed-price ABG project, my process involves:\n\n1.  **Detailed Scope Review:** Once you finalize your detailed scope and timeline, I'll thoroughly review it to understand all requirements, deliverables, and potential complexities.\n2.  **Breakdown & Estimate:** I then break the project down into key phases or milestones. Based on the estimated effort for each, I'll propose a comprehensive fixed price.\n3.  **Agreement:** We'd then discuss the proposed cost to ensure it aligns with your expectations for a fair and competitive agreement.\n\nI'm ready to dive in as soon as your scope is available!"

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Thanks, that process sounds clear. To help us prepare, what payment terms do you typically offer for fixed-price projects? We're eager to share the finalized scope very soon."
